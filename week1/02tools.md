# tools of the trade

## what you need to get started.

in class we are going to use a free account on [c9](https://c9.io/) if you would
prefer to use your own laptop you will need:

### a text editor

if you don't already have one that you love, you may want to try one of these:  
[vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)  
[vim](http://www.vim.org/)  
[atom](https://atom.io/)

### nodejs

[nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/)

### a terminal and shell

if you are using a unix like operating system (linux, mac, bsd) you are all set.
if you are using a windows operating system make sure to install 'git bash' when
you install git. 'git bash' will allow you to use some unix command line tools
in a bash-like environment. These are the commands that I will be demonstrating
in class, and it is important to be familiar with them as most of the worlds
servers are running a Linux OS.

### git

[git](https://git-scm.com/)

eventually we will need a few other tools and throughout the course you will be
installing modules to complete projects, but this is will get you through the
first couple of weeks.
